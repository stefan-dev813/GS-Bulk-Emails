## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. **Set Up Your Google Sheet**  
   Populate the sheet with the following structure:
   - **Column A**: Recipient Email Address
   - **Column B**: Email Subject
   - **Column C**: Email Body
   - **Column D**: Last Sent Timestamp (auto-updated)
   - **Column E**: First Open Timestamp (auto-updated)
   - **Column F**: Last Open Timestamp (auto-updated)
   - **Column G**: Total Opens (auto-updated)

2. **Send Emails**  
   - Open your Google Sheet.
   - Click on the custom **Email Sender** menu.
   - Select **Send Emails** and input the starting row and number of emails to process.

3. **Track Opens**  
   - A hidden tracking pixel is appended to each email.  
   - Email opens are logged in real-time, updating the Google Sheet automatically.

## ‚úâÔ∏è Email Template

The script appends a hidden tracking pixel to your email body to monitor opens.

### Example Email Body in Google Sheet:

| **Recipient**       | **Subject**       | **Body** |
|----------------------|-------------------|----------|
| john.doe@example.com | Welcome to Our Service! | `<p>Hi John,</p><p>Welcome to our service! We're thrilled to have you.</p><p>Best, The Team</p>` |

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

1. Replace placeholders in the code:
   - `SHEET_ID`: Your Google Sheet ID.
   - `SHEET_NAME`: Your sheet's name.
   - `Deploy_URL`: The deployed web app URL for tracking.

2. Add the accompanying HTML file (`form.html`) for the email-sending dialog.

3. Deploy the script as a **web app**:
   - Navigate to **Extensions > Apps Script** in Google Sheets.
   - Publish the project as a web app to enable tracking functionality.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

Open Tracking is not working. Using only Google App Scripts is impossible to track the statement of emails. I receommend to use Third-Party such as SendGrid, MailGun, or others.
